                                            <p>Lucid dreaming—the phenomenon of experiencing waking levels of
                                                self-reflection within
                                                one’s dreams—is associated with more wake-like levels of neural
                                                activation in prefrontal
                                                brain regions. In addition, alternating periods of wakefulness and sleep
                                                might increase
                                                the likelihood of experiencing a lucid dream. Here we investigate the
                                                association between
                                                sleep fragmentation and lucid dreaming, with a multi-centre study
                                                encompassing four different
                                                investigations into subjective and objective measures of sleep
                                                fragmentation, nocturnal awakenings,
                                                sleep quality and polyphasic sleep schedules. Results across these four
                                                studies provide a more
                                                nuanced picture into the purported connection between sleep
                                                fragmentation and lucid dreaming:
                                                While self-assessed numbers of awakenings, polyphasic sleep and

                                                sleep transitions were associated with lucid dreaming, neither
                                                self-assessed sleep quality, nor
                                                physiologically validated numbers of awakenings were. We discuss these
                                                results, and their underlying
                                                neural mechanisms, within the general question of whether sleep
                                                fragmentation and lucid dreaming share
                                                a causal link.

                                            <p>Despite a high prevalence and broad interest in flying dreams, these
                                                exceptional experiences remain infrequent. Our
                                                study aimed to (1) induce flying dreams using a custom-built virtual
                                                reality (VR) flying task, (2) examine their
                                                phenomenological correlates and (3) investigate their relations to
                                                participant state and trait factors. 137 participants
                                                underwent VR-flying followed by a morning nap. They also completed home
                                                dream journals for 5 days before and 10 days
                                                after the VR exposure. VR-flying successfully increased the reporting of
                                                flying dreams during the laboratory nap and on
                                                the following morning compared to both baseline frequencies and a
                                                control cohort. Flying dreams were also changed
                                                qualitatively, exhibiting higher levels of Lucid-control and emotional
                                                intensity, after VR exposure. Factors such as
                                                prior dream-flying experiences and level of VR sensory immersion
                                                modulated flying dream induction. Findings are
                                                consistent with a new vection-based explanation of dream-flying and may
                                                facilitate development of dream flight-induction
                                                technologies.

                                            <p>Lucid dreams often coincide with having control over dream events in
                                                real-time, although the limitations of dream
                                                control are not completely understood. The current study probed the
                                                ability of lucid dreamers to reinstate waking scene
                                                memories while dreaming. After brief exposure to an experimental scene,
                                                participants were asked to reinstate the scene
                                                while lucid dreaming (i.e., change dream scenery to match real-world
                                                scene). Qualitative analysis revealed that
                                                successful dream scene reinstatements were overwhelmingly inaccurate
                                                with respect to the original experimental scene.
                                                Importantly, reinstatement inaccuracies held even when the dreamer was

                                                dissociation between memory access while dreaming and dream imagery. The
                                                ability to change the environment of a dream
                                                speaks to the high amount of lucid dream control, yet the inaccuracies
                                                speak to a lack of detailed control. Reinstating
                                                context during lucid sleep offers an experimental method to investigate
                                                sleep, dreams, and memory.

                                                engineering. We begin by emphasizing the causal role of the body in
                                                dream generation, and describe a circuitry between
                                                the sleeping body and the dreaming mind. We suggest that nearly any
                                                sensory stimuli has potential for modulating
                                                experience in sleep. Considering other areas that might afford tools for

                                                relevant VR technologies, including devices
                                                engineered to stimulate haptic, temperature, vestibular, olfactory, and
                                                auditory sensations. We believe these
                                                technologies, which have been developed for high mobility and low cost,
                                                can be translated to the field of dream
                                                engineering. We close by discussing possible future directions in this
                                                field and the ethics of a world in which targeted

                                        <p>The reliable induction of lucid dreams is a challenge in lucid dream
                                            research. In a previous study by our research group
                                            we were able to induce in about 50% of the participants a lucid dream in
                                            a single sleep laboratory night by combining a
                                            wake-up-back-to-bed sleep protocol and a mnemonic technique. In the
                                            present study, we extended our previous procedure by
                                            additional presentation of an odor during sleep to reactivate memory
                                            traces about reality testing. In total 16 male
                                            participants spent a single night in the sleep lab whereas the procedure
                                            induced in two participants a lucid dream
                                            (12.5%). The induction rate stays below the success rate of our previous
                                            study and therefore odor-cueing seems not a
                                            promising technique for inducing lucid dreams. Beside the odor
                                            presentation, several other methodological changes have
                                            been made, which will be discussed and hopefully help further dream
                                            engineering to improve induction techniques.

                                        <p>Lucid dreaming is a unique phenomenon with potential applications for
                                            therapeutic interventions. Few studies have
                                            investigated the effects of lucidity on an individual’s waking mood,
                                            which could have valuable implications for
                                            improving psychological wellbeing. The current experiment aims to
                                            investigate whether the experience of lucidity
                                            enhances positive waking mood, and whether lucidity is associated with
                                            dream emotional content and subjective sleep
                                            quality. 20 participants were asked to complete lucid dream induction
                                            techniques along with an online dream diary for
                                            one week, which featured a 19-item lucidity questionnaire, and
                                            subjective ratings of sleep quality, dream emotional
                                            content, and waking mood. Results indicated that higher lucidity was
                                            associated with more positive dream content and
                                            elevated positive waking mood the next day, although there was no
                                            relationship with sleep quality. The results of the
                                            research and suggestions for future investigations, such as the need for
                                            longitudinal studies of lucidity and mood, are
                                            discussed.

                                        <p>Information processing during sleep is active, ongoing and accessible to
                                            engineering. Protocols such as targeted memory
                                            reactivation use sensory stimuli during sleep to reactivate memories and
                                            demonstrate subsequent, specific enhancement of
                                            their consolidation. These protocols rely on physiological, as opposed
                                            to phenomenological, evidence of their
                                            reactivation. While dream content can predict post-sleep memory
                                            enhancement, dreaming itself remains a black box. Here,
                                            we present a novel protocol using a new wearable electronic device,
                                            Dormio, to automatically generate serial auditory
                                            dream incubations at sleep onset, wherein targeted information is
                                            repeatedly presented during the hypnagogic period,
                                            enabling direct incorporation of this information into dream content, a
                                            process we call targeted dream incubation (TDI).
                                            Along with validation data, we discuss how Dormio and TDI protocols can
                                            serve as tools for controlled experimentation on
                                            dream content, shedding light on the role of dreams in the overnight
                                            transformation of experiences into memories.
