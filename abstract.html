                                    <u>Abstract:</u> Sleep supports the strengthening of newly acquired memories.
                                    Our
                                    recent work has demonstrated that this optimization of
                                    memory unfolds progressively during sleep, and for motor skills memory, results
                                    in a
                                    strengthened and transformed memory
                                    trace, as a result of reactivation during sleep spindle events. Trait-like
                                    interindividual differences in
                                    spindle-related brain activation are also related to interindividual Fluid
                                    Intelligence. Moreover, the extent of
                                    learning-related incorporation of newly acquired information into dream content
                                    is
                                    related to intellectual functioning.
                                    Thus, sleep is involved in memory consolidation, reflected by the
                                    transformation,
                                    restoration and strengthening of
                                    functional brain networks involved in learning. Sleep also supports intellectual
                                    functioning, which is reflected in the
                                    content of our dreams. <br>

                                    <u>Abstract:</u> For reasons not
                                    currently well understood, humans are typically unaware that they are dreaming
                                    while
                                    dreaming. At times,
                                    however, a remarkable exception occurs and we can regain full reflective
                                    consciousness during sleep, and become
                                    aware of the fact that we are dreaming, a state referred to as lucid dreaming.
                                    Despite having been
                                    physiologically validated for decades, the neurobiology of lucid dreaming is
                                    still
                                    incompletely characterized.
                                    In this talk I will discuss several recent findings that shed new light on this
                                    question. Using an individual
                                    differences approach, our recent neuroimaging findings converge with previous
                                    results in providing preliminary
                                    evidence for a role of anterior prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortices in
                                    lucid
                                    dreaming. Furthermore, our
                                    recent findings suggest that a state of the brain conductive to lucid dreaming
                                    can
                                    be induced pharmacologically
                                    with acetycholinesterase inhibition. Finally, I will discuss recent findings
                                    that
                                    illustrate the potential of
                                    lucid dreaming as a useful methodology for the cognitive neuroscience of
                                    consciousness. <br><u>Reference:</u>

                                    <u>Abstract:</u> Lucid dreaming can be
                                    a valuable tool for developing our understanding of sleep and consciousness, but
                                    several obstacles complicate
                                    experimental studies of the phenomenon. In this presentation, I present results
                                    from
                                    two studies aimed at
                                    overcoming some of these obstacles. Firstly, lucid dreams can be difficult to
                                    capture in a sleep laboratory
                                    setting. To address this challenge, I present results of a new method of
                                    lucid-dream
                                    induction based on targeted
                                    memory reactivation (TMR), involving pre-sleep training and presenting cues

                                    REM sleep. Using this method,
                                    we successfully induced lucid dreams in 56% of participants in a single morning

                                    to address two more challenges in dream research, the unpredictability of dream
                                    content and the reliance on
                                    retrospective reports. With a TMR-based method for producing two-way

                                    suggest that 40-Hz oscillations in frontal brain circuits are associated with
                                    lucid
                                    dreaming (LD) and that
                                    transcranial 40-Hz stimulation delivered frontally during REM sleep may induce
                                    either LDs or heightened
                                    self-awareness during dreaming. Both transcranial direct (tDC) and alternating
                                    (tAC)
                                    current stimulation during
                                    sleep have been shown to be effective, but methodological weaknesses of these 2
                                    studies prompted us to attempt a
                                    replication. 40-Hz tAC stimulation was thus delivered during REM sleep (STIM
                                    condition) in groups of LD-naive,
                                    LD-experienced, and nightmare-prone individuals and measures of LD compared with
                                    non-stimulation (SHAM) control
                                    conditions. Signal verification of a LD, using left-right eye movement
                                    sequences,
                                    was accomplished by 15% of
                                    subjects in STIM trials. However, they were also produced in 21% of SHAM trials.

                                    self-awareness were also similar for STIM and SHAM trials. Follow-up conditions

                                    Nightmare is the Most Useful Dream - Revisited
                                    Idiopathic nightmares are often viewed as problematic but their experiential
                                    intensity makes them a powerful
                                    vehicle for clinical change. Emotional memory reconsolidation theory suggests if
                                    we
                                    experientially encounter
                                    something directly incompatible with what we believe, the emotional memory
                                    associated with that belief becomes
                                    unstable and amenable to lasting change (under very specific conditions). I will
                                    talk about how this kind of
                                    change can happen in clinical practice, and suggest that dreamwork is a way of
                                    understanding (and potentially
                                    enhancing) the emotional regulation and memory revision processes that dreams
                                    themselves are implicated in.
                                    Nightmares are particularly powerful change agents because of the strong emotion
                                    and

                                    Idiopathic nightmare disorder (IND) is a relatively prevalent sleep complaint
                                    and
                                    constitutes a risk factor for
                                    psychiatric conditions, especially PTSD. Despite its clinical relevance, the
                                    pathophysiology of frequent
                                    nightmares was only scarcely investigated; however, some of the previous studies
                                    indicate impaired sleep
                                    regulation and altered arousal-related activity in IND. Our aim was to examine
                                    sleep
                                    and dream quality,
                                    PTSD-like symptomatology, as well as electroencephalographic markers of sleep
                                    regulation and arousal-related
                                    cortical activity in IND. The relative spectral power during NREM and REM
                                    periods,
                                    as well as during NREM, to
                                    REM transitions was compared across 22 idiopathic nightmare sufferers (NMs) and
                                    22
                                    matched healthy controls.
                                    Moreover, participants completed questionnaires with respect to sleep quality,
                                    dream
                                    experiences and mental
                                    complaints. NMs compared to CTLs scored higher on PTSD-like symptoms, and
                                    reported
                                    significantly higher negative
                                    dream emotions and negative affect upon awakening. Although subjective sleep
                                    quality
                                    was not different across
                                    groups, NMs showed a lower amount of Slow Wave Sleep during the night.
                                    Furthermore,
                                    NMs exhibited reduced slow
                                    frequency and increased fast frequency activity during NREM sleep, and increased
                                    high alpha-low beta power in
                                    REM sleep resembling wake-like activity. Analyses of sleep state transitions
                                    indicated impaired sleep regulation
                                    and hyperarousal in NMs, especially during NREM to REM transitions. Our findings
                                    indicate an imbalance between
                                    sleep regulatory and wake promoting systems in NMs. Impaired sleep regulation
                                    and
                                    hyperarousal seem to
                                    characterize the pathophysiology of IND that might contribute to the development

                                    <u>Abstract:</u> Memory replays during sleep can be triggered by replaying a
                                    stimulus associated with prior learning, a method known as
                                    targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Whether TMR influences whole-body procedural
                                    learning and whether it relates to
                                    dream ‘replays’ is still unknown. Our study aims to enhance procedural learning
                                    of a VR-flying task with TMR and assess
                                    whether dream content is influenced by it. A total of 59 healthy participants
                                    (23.67±4.22 yrs old; 34 F) took part in
                                    the VR task prior to and following a polysomnographically-recorded morning nap,

                                    either replayed in NREM sleep (N=19; Stim-NREM), in REM sleep (N=19; Stim-REM)
                                    or were absent (N=20; Control). Our
                                    procedural task uses the VIVE room-scale system and involves flying through a
                                    circuit of rings in a virtual environment
                                    as precisely and quickly as possible, to engage vestibular and motor systems. A
                                    mixed-design ANOVA revealed a
                                    significant interaction between time (pre-nap, post-nap) and condition
                                    (Stim-NREM, Stim-REM, Control), F(2,55)=8.370,
                                    p=.0007, with a better post-nap performance for the Stim-REM group compared with
                                    controls (p=.048). Contrary to our
                                    expectations, the presence of the auditory stimulation during sleep was related
                                    with lower self-reported lucidity in
                                    dream content and did not enhance dream replays of the VR task. However, across
                                    all groups, dreams incorporating
                                    kinesthetic elements similar to the VR task (e.g. flying, floating, driving
                                    fast) were associated with marginally higher
                                    improvement compared with no incorporation (p=.081), while dreaming about static
                                    visual elements of the task (i.e.
                                    landscapes) was not (p=.816). These results, although preliminary, suggest that
                                    TMR during REM sleep could influence
                                    sensorimotor skill performance. Independently, dreaming about proprioceptive
                                    elements of the procedural task is also
                                    associated with larger improvement in performance. Findings may help understand
                                    the relationship between dreaming and
                                    procedural memory consolidation processes and the development of new sleep-based
                                    methods that use VR to optimize motor
                                    memory.

                                    prospective memory during early-morning sleep
                                    The present study combines our pilot findings of relatively high inductions
                                    rates – even in unselected students – with
                                    the findings that tasks that are learned during wakefulness coupled with a

                                    if this odor is presented. We expect an even higher induction rate of inducing

                                    Title: Dream Reporting May Shift Memory Processing To A Gist-Like State
                                    Authors: Enmanuelle Pardilla-Delgado and Jessica D. Payne

                                    Gist-based false memory has been widely studied using the
                                    Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) task, in which participants,
                                    after studying a list of semantically related words (nurse, sick, hospital,
                                    etc.), later falsely remember an unstudied
                                    ‘gist’ word (doctor). Sleeping soon after learning benefits studied words (i.e.
                                    nurse, sick) and memory for gist (i.e.
                                    doctor) when tested 24 or 48hr after encoding. It has been proposed that,
                                    through trace reactivation, memory-related
                                    content may be incorporated into dreams, and reports of stimulus-related dream
                                    content have been shown to increase
                                    subsequent performance. Here we explored whether dreaming about the DRM task
                                    would modulate sleep-based memory
                                    enhancement. Participants encoded 16 DRM lists in the evening and were tested
                                    either 24 or 48 hours later. Testing
                                    consisted of a free recall task followed by a recognition test. For both tests,
                                    participants had to indicate how
                                    confident they were in their responses using a 1-4 Likert scale. They spent
                                    their first night in our laboratory while
                                    their sleep was monitored with PSG. The following morning, participants were
                                    awakened and asked to report their
                                    mentation and then were asked a yes/no question about whether they dreamt about
                                    the DRM task and/or words. There was no
                                    difference in memory for studied words between participants who reported
                                    task-related mentation (YES, n=18) and those
                                    who did not (NO, n=37), all t’s <1.15, all p’s> .26. However, when subjects were
                                        highly confident in their gist memory
                                        (3-4 ratings), recognition memory was elevated in the YES group, compared to
                                        the NO group t(53)=1.98, p=.05.
                                        Similarly, high-confidence false recall was increased in the YES group,
                                        compared to the NO group t(53)=3.17, p=.003.
                                        These results suggest a role for dreaming in the “gistification” of
                                        memories, particularly for those memories that
                                        were consolidated more strongly and later retrieved with high
                                        confidence.<br><u>Reference:</u>

                                    (p=0.15). Relationships of CPI
                                    with these rates were weaker: nightmares (p=0.52), bad-dreams (p=0.013), bad

                                    Sleep disturbances are core manifestations of PTSD. We examined the
                                    association of nightmares and bad dreams with composite index scores of
                                    psychopathology and hyperarousal. Individuals exposed to a PTSD Criterion-A
                                    trauma within the past 2-years (N=70, 45 females) completed the Clinician-
                                    Administered PTSD Scale (range=0-50, mean=21.4, SD=12.8; 32 meeting
                                    DSM-IV-TR PTSD criteria). They also completed questionnaires measuring
                                    hyperarousal (Composite Hyperarousal Index; CHI), general psychopathology
                                    (Composite Psychopathology Index; CPI), and 12-27 nights of sleep diaries
                                    (mean=14.8, SD=2.45) asking if recalled dreams were nightmares (caused
                                    waking) or bad dreams and their resemblance to trauma. CHI significantly
                                    predicted nightmares (R=0.32, p=0.008), bad-dreams (R=0.33, p=0.006), and
                                    their combined rates (R=0.411, p=0.0007), but not trauma-related-nightmares
                                    (p=0.15). Relationships of CPI with these rates were weaker: nightmares
                                    (p=0.52), bad-dreams (p=0.013), bad dreams/nightmares (p=0.049), and
                                    trauma-related-nightmares (p=0.68). Since hyperarousal scores predicted
                                    nightmare and bad dream rates better than general psychopathology,
                                    interventions focusing more on features of hyperarousal may assist in treating
                                    trauma-related nightmares.<br><u>Reference:</u> </p>

                                    Targeted memory reactivation
                                    (TMR) during sleep typically requires expensive and specialized hardware, which
                                    limits subject count and
                                    applicability in everyday life. We have developed apps for TMR with consumer

                                    exploring how these devices can trigger TMR on specific sleep events and measure

                                    The question of a possible link between dream content and memory consolidation
                                    remains open as revealed by a
                                    review of the few studies which tested whether the incorporation of a new task
                                    into
                                    dream reports is associated
                                    with improved post-sleep memory performance. To further test this hypothesis, 32
                                    high dream recallers freely
                                    explored new visuo-olfactory episodes (odors presented at precise locations of a
                                    landscape picture), for 3
                                    consecutive days. During the 3 nights following each non-explicit encoding,
                                    participants wore a wrist actimeter,
                                    and woke up at 5am and at their usual waking time to report their possible
                                    dreams.
                                    Among the 192 awakenings 120
                                    led to a dream report. The scoring of dream reports yielded the identification
                                    of
                                    elements related to the
                                    encoding phase in 22 of them. It was mainly visual elements (odors related to
                                    the
                                    encoding phase were identified
                                    in only two dream reports). The 4th day, as compared to the other participants,
                                    participants who had reported
                                    learning-related dreams had no significantly better performance at odor
                                    recognition
                                    and odor-evoked episodic
                                    memory, but they did have better memory of the visuo-spatial part of the
                                    episodes.
                                    Our findings suggest that
                                    only those elements which were incorporated into dreams were better
                                    consolidated.<br><u>Reference:</u>

                                    Stress levels and sleep have both individually been shown to impact memory
                                    encoding
                                    and consolidation, affecting
                                    subsequent memory retrieval. Additionally, when present in close spatial or
                                    temporal
                                    proximity, salient,
                                    negative-valanced stimuli are prioritized in memory over neutral-valanced
                                    counterparts (i.e. emotional memory
                                    trade-off). Here, we probed emotional memory trade-off using an in vivo
                                    incidental
                                    encoding task that was
                                    followed by overnight sleep.

                                    Methods
                                    Sixty-five participants (35 female; age 18-31, M=21.9±2.7) completed a baseline
                                    sleep assessment with actigraphy
                                    and self-reported sleep quality prior to the first experimental session.
                                    Participants were then randomized to
                                    complete one of two incidental encoding tasks involving either a validated
                                    psychosocial stressor (Trier Social
                                    Stress Test [TSST]) or matched control task. During TSST (Stress condition) or
                                    control task (Control condition),
                                    neutral items (e.g. stapler, tape dispenser, coat hanger) placed in various
                                    locations within the testing room
                                    served as targets for incidental encoding. In the Stress condition, but not
                                    Control
                                    condition, judges served as
                                    salient, stress-inducing between-subjects probes for emotional memory trade-off.
                                    Task-evoked stress was assessed
                                    by salivary cortisol rise from pre- to 20-mins post-encoding (CortPeak).
                                    Post-encoding overnight sleep was
                                    recorded with PSG. The following day, participants were given a recognition task
                                    that included a list of
                                    possible items previously encountered in the testing room where incidental
                                    encoding
                                    occurred. Participants gave
                                    high/low confidence ratings about the presence or absence of listed items.
                                    Between-group recall performance was
                                    assessed using number of hits (i.e. correct identification of items that were
                                    present during encoding) and false
                                    alarms (i.e. incorrect identification of items that were absent during
                                    encoding).

                                    Results
                                    Groups did not differ by subjective (PSQI) or objective (actigraphy-measured
                                    TST,

                                    N2%, SWS%, REM% and NREM sleep spindle density) sleep measures (all ps>.152).
                                    Condition-dependent stress was
                                    established by greater CortPeak in Stress vs. Control group,
                                    t(34.96)=3.76,p=.001.
                                    Independent samples t-tests
                                    were used to compare between-group hits and false alarms at both levels of
                                    confidence (high [HC]/low [LC]).
                                    Compared with Stress group, Controls achieved significantly more HC hits,
                                    t(58)=-2.66, p=0.01. All other
                                    comparisons were non-significant (all ps>0.33). Post-hoc correlations in the
                                    Stress
                                    group only revealed that
                                    false alarms were negatively associated with SWS% (r=-.365, p=0.044), suggesting
                                    that diminished SWS increased
                                    the tendency toward falsely remembering non-existent features of the testing
                                    room.
                                    In Controls, overnight REM%
                                    correlated positively (r=.415,p=.025), and N1% negatively (r=-.378, p=.043),
                                    with
                                    overall hits. HC hits
                                    correlated positively with NREM sleep spindle density measured from frontal EEG
                                    channels (r=.415,p=.028).

                                    Conclusions
                                    The present findings represent novel evidence for in vivo emotional memory

                                    for neutral items was reduced when salient, stress-inducing stimuli were present
                                    during encoding. When a
                                    stressor was present, greater post-encoding SWS appeared to have a protective

                                    was reduced by higher proportions of light post-encoding sleep and enhanced by

                                    processing is gaining
                                    increasing support, its effect on emotion regulation remains equivocal.
                                    Moreover,
                                    little is known about the link
                                    between emotional reactivity at the time of encoding and subsequent sleep-based
                                    emotional memory consolidation.
                                    This study examined whether sleep would potentiate, protect, or depotentiate
                                    measures of heart rate and skin
                                    conductance in response to scenes containing emotional and neutral objects, and
                                    assessed how these measures of
                                    reactivity would predict subsequent memory for the objects across delays of
                                    sleep
                                    and wake. Heart rate
                                    deceleration (HRD) and skin conductance response (SCR) data were collected at
                                    encoding and recognition. Although
                                    HRD and SCR reactivity to objects were depotentiated after a sleep-filled delay,
                                    they remained unchanged after a
                                    delay containing wakefulness. Moreover, increased arousal responses to negative
                                    scenes at encoding as measured
                                    by HRD and SCR responses were positively correlated with subsequent memory for
                                    the
                                    negative objects of scenes,
                                    but only in the sleep group. This suggests that larger reactions to negative
                                    images
                                    at the time of encoding set
                                    the stage for the preferential consolidation of these images during a night of
                                    sleep. Although arousal responses
                                    are often thought to account for emotional enhancement in long-term memory,
                                    these
                                    findings suggest that both an
                                    arousal response at encoding and a subsequent period of sleep are needed to
                                    optimize

                                    technologies that enable
                                    non-invasive control of neural activity hold a great potential for serving an
                                    important role not only in
                                    treating neurological disorders, but also in modulating and possibly improving
                                    brain
                                    functions in the healthy
                                    brain. We have developed non-invasive brain modulation strategies that can
                                    either
                                    target a specific area inside
                                    the brain or simultaneously stimulate multiple brain regions. These strategies
                                    include non-invasive deep brain
                                    stimulation using temporal interference (Grossman et al., 2017) and modulation
                                    of
                                    brain oscillations using
                                    sensory stimulation. Temporal interference uniquely enables non-invasive
                                    stimulation
                                    of a specific brain region
                                    by utilizing multiple high frequency electric fields whose interference produces
                                    a
                                    prominent electric field
                                    envelope that affects the neural activity only at a desired location inside the
                                    brain. On the other hand,
                                    sensory stimulation relies on the natural neural pathways that are responsible
                                    for
                                    detecting and processing
                                    sensory information. Although previous works have shown that stimuli that target
                                    a
                                    certain sense can effectively
                                    modulate neural oscillations in the primary sensory area of the brain that is
                                    responsible for that sense, the
                                    effect of combining multiple sensory stimuli is not well understood. Our
                                    preliminary
                                    data shows combining
                                    multiple sensory stimuli can lead to a strong neural response at multiple brain
                                    regions. Given sleep and dreams
                                    have been closely linked to specific brain oscillations and activities at
                                    various
                                    parts of the brain, our

                                    <u>Abstract:</u> Lucid dreaming, knowing one is dreaming while dreaming, is an
                                    important tool for exploring consciousness and bringing
                                    awareness to different aspects of life. We present a proof-of-concept system
                                    called Lucid Loop: a virtual reality
                                    experience where one can practice lucid awareness via biofeedback. Visuals are
                                    creatively generated before your eyes
                                    using a deep learning Artificial Intelligence algorithm to emulate the unstable
                                    and ambiguous nature of dreams. The
                                    virtual environment becomes more lucid or “clear” when the participant’s
                                    physiological signals, including brain waves,
                                    respiration, and heart rate, indicate focused attention. Lucid Loop enables the
                                    virtual embodied experience of
                                    practicing lucid dreaming where written descriptions fail. It offers a valuable
                                    and novel technique for simulating lucid
                                    dreaming without having to be asleep. Future developments will validate the
                                    system and evaluate its ability to improve
                                    lucidity within the system by detecting and adapting to a participants
                                    awareness.<br><u>Reference:</u> Kitson, A., Schiphorst, T., & Riecke, B. E.
