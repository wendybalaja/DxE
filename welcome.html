                            <p>The First International Dream x Engineering (DxE) Workshop, hosted at the MIT Media
                                Laboratory in January 2019, began as
                                a conversation between dream researcher Dr. Michelle Carr, and dream engineers Dr.
                                Pattie Maes, Adam Haar Horowitz and
                                Judith Amores.
                            </p>

                            <p>In the Media Lab Fluid Interfaces group, <a
                                    href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/theme-engineering-dreams/overview/"

                                    wealth of innovative devices have been
                                    developed with dream science
                                    applications</a>. Dr. Carr reached out to the group in early 2018 with an interest
                                in using
                                their devices in her own sleep
                                laboratory studies, and in collaborations with dream scientists around the world.</p>

                                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
                                    <span class="image"><img src="images/welcome/welcome-1.png" /></span>

                            </div>
                            <p>The conversation organically grew into a much larger effort to bring together a whole
                                group of dream scientists and
                                engineers to jumpstart the field of Dream Engineering.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Carr invited more than 30 sleep and dream researchers from around the world, curating
                                the scientific program for the
                                first DxE workshop. The Fluid Interfaces group developed a cutting-edge technology
                                program, inviting tech speakers and
                                demo presenters from the Media Lab and beyond.</p>

                            <p>For two days at the end of January 2019, worlds collided. Panel speakers revealed what
                                science is unearthing about sleep
                                and dreams, and their importance for learning, creativity, and emotional well-being.
                                Tech demos and brainstorm sessions
                                inspired creative new tools for dream experimentation, both within and beyond the sleep
                                laboratory.</p>
