                                        Laboratory</a> in January 2019, began as
                                    a collaboration between sleep and dream researcher Dr. Michelle Carr, and dream
                                    engineers in
                                    the MIT Media Laboratory
                                    Fluid Interfaces group led by Dr. Pattie Maes, Professor in Media Arts and Sciences,
                                    including students Adam Haar
                                    Horowitz and Judith Amores.
                                </p>
                                <p>Dr. Carr, currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the University of Rochester Sleep and
                                    Neurophysiology Laboratory,
                                    initially reached out to the group in early 2018 with an interest in using their
                                    dream
                                    engineering technology in her own
                                    sleep laboratory studies. In the Fluid Interfaces group, <a
                                        href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/theme-engineering-dreams/overview/">a
                                        wealth of
                                        innovative devices have
                                        been developed with dream
                                        engineering applications.</a>
                                </p>
                                <p>For instance, the Masca device detects rapid eye movements during sleep and triggers
                                    awakenings for dream reports. The
                                    Dormio device uses sensors on a sleeper’s fingers that detect muscle flexion, heart
                                    rate,
                                    and skin conductance, then
                                    uses these signals to prompt the sleeper to incubate specific dream content at sleep
                                    onset.
                                    The Essence device has
                                    evolved over several years and can be worn as a necklace or attached to a
                                    nightstand; the
                                    device can be programmed to
                                    release a desired scent when the user is asleep and dreaming. MoveU is a simple
                                    electrical
                                    stimulation device worn on
                                    the neck that can simulate shifts in balance, and could be a wearable alternative to
                                    induce
                                    rocking motions that ease
                                    sleep onset. PhysioHMD is a device that can detect all of the necessary signals for
                                    scoring
                                    sleep, but in a flexible,
                                    comfortable, and portable mask, originally designed to comfortably fit under Virtual
                                    Reality
                                    headsets. Finally, Frisson
                                    uses cascading electrical stimulation at specific points along the back, to induce
                                    the
                                    sensation of chills on demand.
                                    All of these devices are designed to be low-cost and portable, and open exiting new
                                    avenues
                                    of sleep and dream
                                    experimentation.

                                <p>But what started as a personal collaboration between Dr. Carr and the Fluid
                                    Interfaces group
                                    organically grew into a
                                    concerted effort, bringing together a wide-ranging group of dream scientists and
                                    engineers
                                    to jumpstart the field of
                                    Dream Engineering. And Dr. Carr has deep roots in the field; after working as an
                                    undergraduate in the Rochester Sleep
                                    Lab, she has trained in sleep laboratories around the world, including graduate work
                                    at the
                                    Dream and Nightmare
                                    Laboratory in Montreal with Dr. Tore Nielsen, postdoctoral training with Prof. Mark
                                    Blagrove
                                    at the Swansea University
                                    Sleep Laboratory, and numerous research visits and collaborations: with Dr. Martin
                                    Dresler
                                    at the Donders Institute in
                                    the Netherlands; Dr. Francesca Siclari at the Center for Investigation and Research
                                    in Sleep
                                    in Switzerland; Dr. Katja
                                    Valli at the Turku Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience; and Dr. Ken Paller at
                                    Northwestern
                                    University in Chicago.
                                </p>

                                <p>Many of these researchers shared a similar interest in engineering dreams, conducting
                                    laboratory studies that ranged
                                    from inducing lucid dreams with sensory stimulation, manipulating dreamed body
                                    movement
                                    through electrical brain
                                    stimulation, or using Virtual Reality to influence dream content. Thus, after
                                    obtaining a
                                    grant from the British
                                    Psychological Society to visit the Media Laboratory in January of 2019, Dr. Carr
                                    reached out
                                    to more than 30 sleep and
                                    dream researchers around the world and curated the scientific program for the first
                                    DxE
                                    workshop. At MIT, Dr. Maes and
                                    the Fluid Interfaces group developed a cutting-edge technology program for the
                                    workshop,
                                    preparing for and inviting tech
                                    speakers and demo presenters from the Media Laboratory and beyond.</p>

                                <p>For two days at the end of January 2019, worlds collided between dream laboratory
                                    researchers
                                    and engineers. There is so
                                    much that science is unearthing about sleep and dreams, and their importance for
                                    learning,
                                    creativity, and emotional
                                    well-being. The energy and inspiration at the workshop burst from a desire to create
                                    better
                                    tools to help individuals,
                                    both within and beyond the sleep laboratory. The connections developed at the
                                    workshop
                                    resulted in numerous
                                    collaborations between dream scientists and engineers and suggest an exciting future
                                    for the
                                    field of Dream Engineering.</p>

                                    Maes, Horowitz, and Amores. The team also collaborated with Dr. Pedro Lopes at the
                                    University of Chicago and others from
                                    the Media Laboratory to publish a comprehensive theoretical review on the concept of

                                    2020). The authors discuss how simple sensory technologies – borrowed from the

                                    Human-Computer Interaction and
                                    Virtual Reality Simulation – can be applied to engineer dreams during sleep.</p>
