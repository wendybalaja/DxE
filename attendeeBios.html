                                    Berkeley. His work using EEG, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging has contributed to

                                    of human memory. In this work, he has contrasted conscious memory experiences with

                                    influence behavior in the absence of awareness of memory retrieval, as in implicit
                                    social bias, priming, and intuition.
                                    Recent studies from his lab showed that sensory processing during sleep can
                                    reinforce prior learning, providing novel

                                <p><br><strong>Bio: </strong>For over 30 years, my research in the Dream & Nightmare
                                    Laboratory has concerned
                                    the neuroscience of dreaming and nightmares. I direct a 2-bed sleep laboratory in

                                    imaging methods to
                                    quantify sleep. We have focused on quantifying the physiological differences between
                                    REM
                                    and NREM dreaming,
                                    on determing the delayed memory sources of dreaming (day-residue and dream-lag
                                    effects),
                                    on characterizing
                                    the neurophysiological basis of nightmares and a variety of other topics. In recent
                                    years, our focus has
                                    been on relationships between dreaming and NREM sleep events, like sleep spindles
                                    and
                                    the possible role of

                                    studied several neurobiological correlates of dream recall and dream content
                                    including
                                    EEG power,
                                    localization and coherence, sleep macro- and microstructure (e.g., sleep spindles),
                                    SPECT and fMRI brain
                                    imaging, and EMG activity. We have also assessed the effects of external stimuli on
                                    dream content, including
                                    the effects of films and virtual environments. We have assessed the correlates and

                                    REM/NREM dreams and brief sleep onset images. We have examined the role of dreaming

                                    finishing his PhD in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Notre Dame. His
                                    main research interests are memory
                                    consolidation and transformation. His research has focused on the interactions
                                    between sleep and memory, as well as
                                    stress and memory. Most of his previous work has focused on the consolidation of
                                    gist-based false memories after a
                                    period of acute stress or a night of sleep. Enma’s interests in the lab include
                                    investigating functional changes in the
                                    brain, particularly in memory-relevant structures, in preclinical Alzheimer’s
                                    disease. He's also interested in how sleep
                                    is disrupted in preclinical AD. He enjoys playing basketball (in real life, and
                                    in video games), Doctor Who, Latin
                                    dancing, and (occasionally) going to the gym.<br> <strong>Research

                                    interest is memory consolidation and transformation. During graduate school he
                                    worked with gist-based false
                                    memories in humans and how sleep affects their processing. Currently, he's
                                    working towards identifying
                                    possible markers of preclinical Alzheimer's in sleep patterns and physiology.

                                    interests lie in the crossroads between memory and dreaming: how are dreams
                                    affected by memory and how is

                                    Group led by Professor Ed
                                    Boyden focuses on the development, optimization, and application of non-invasive
                                    brain modulation tools and
                                    strategies. These strategies include non-invasive deep brain stimulation using
                                    temporal interference
                                    (Grossman et al., 2017) and modulation of brain oscillations using sensory
                                    stimulation. Temporal
                                    interference uniquely enables non-invasive stimulation of a specific brain
                                    region by utilizing multiple high
                                    frequency electric fields whose interference produces a prominent electric field
                                    envelope that affects the
                                    neural activity only at a desired location inside the brain. The ability to
                                    stimulate targeted regions
                                    inside the brain makes temporal interference a potentially useful tool for
                                    applications that require focused
                                    and region-specific brain modulation. On the other hand, sensory (e.g., visual,
                                    auditory, tactile)
                                    stimulation relies on the natural neural pathways that are responsible for
                                    detecting and processing sensory
                                    information. Although previous works have shown that stimuli that target a
                                    certain sense can effectively
                                    modulate neural oscillations in the primary sensory area of the brain that is
                                    responsible for that sense,
                                    the effect of combining multiple sensory stimuli is not well understood. I am
                                    trying to develop and optimize
                                    strategies for combining multiple sensory stimuli for maximal neural response at
                                    multiple brain regions,
                                    which may be useful for applications that require a global modulation of brain
                                    activity. Given sleep and
                                    dreams have been closely linked to specific brain oscillations and activities at
                                    various parts of the brain,
                                    I believe the non-invasive tools I am working on may become a useful tool for
                                    modulating sleep or

                                    information from very noisy sources. We are using deep neural networks to create
                                    new representations for EEG
                                    signals that are more interpretable than raw signals. In particular, we are
                                    building AI enabled

                                <p><br><strong>Bio: </strong>Pedro Lopes is an Assistant Professor at the University
                                    of Chicago, where he leads a research group that asks the
                                    question: what if interfaces would share part of our body? Pedro has
                                    materialized these ideas by creating interactive
                                    systems intentionally borrow parts of the user’s body for input and output;
                                    allowing computers to be more directly
                                    interwoven in our bodily senses and actuators. One specific flavor of such
                                    devices that Pedro has extensively explored
                                    is devices that borrow the user’s muscles by means of electrical muscle
                                    stimulation. These devices use part of the
                                    wearer’s body for output, i.e., the computer can output by actuating the user’s
                                    muscles with electrical impulses,
                                    causing it to move involuntarily. The wearer can sense the computer’s activity
                                    on their own body by means of their sense
                                    of proprioception. Pedro’s wearable systems have shown to (1) increase realism
                                    in VR, (2) provide a novel way to access
                                    information through proprioception, and (3) serve as a platform to experience
                                    and question the boundaries of our sense
                                    of agency. Pedro’s work is published at top-tier conferences (ACM CHI & UIST)
                                    and demonstrated at venues such as
                                    SIGGRAPH and IEEE Haptics. Pedro has received the CHI Best Paper award for his
                                    work on Affordance++, Best Talk Awards
                                    and a Best Paper nomination. As part of his research, Pedro has exhibited at Ars
                                    Electronica 2017, Science Gallery
                                    Dublin and World Economic Forum in San Francisco. His work also captured the
                                    interest of media, such as MIT Technology
                                    Review, NBC, Discovery Channel, NewScientist or Wired. Previously, Pedro was a
                                    PhD student with Prof. Baudisch at the
                                    Hasso Plattner Institute, Germany.<br> <strong>Research

                                    start to interface more directly and bidirectionally with the human body via
                                    muscle sensing and muscle
                                    actuation, we are able to not only sense possible dream states but, in return,
                                    influence the physicality of
                                    the dream states/content by proprioceptive manipulation. <br> <strong>Website:

                                <p><br><strong>Bio: </strong>We each spend about a third of our lives sleeping. Why? As
                                    a cognitive
                                    neuroscientist, Dr. Erin Wamsley studies this relatively uncharted territory,
                                    exploring the function of
                                    sleep, the brain basis of dreaming, and the role of resting states in memory
                                    consolidation more broadly.

                                    Harvard Medical School, Dr. Wamsley joined the faculty at Furman University in 2014,
                                    where she directs the
                                    Furman Sleep Laboratory.<br> <strong>Research interest: </strong>Despite decades of
                                    research effort, the
                                    brain basis of dreaming is still poorly understood. The development of new methods
                                    to experimentally
                                    manipulate the dream experience and its neural substrates could provide a
                                    breakthrough in this area.<br>
