                                <p>The Special Issue brings together a collection of papers on the theme of Dream
                                    Engineering â€“ applying techniques and
                                    technologies for influencing, recording, and manipulating dreams to benefit
                                    memory, creativity or wellbeing. Invited
                                    contributors include those who attended the first international workshop on
                                    Dream Engineering hosted at the MIT Media
                                    Laboratory in January 2019, which was very successful in bringing together over
                                    50 leading scientists, dream researchers
                                    and engineers who have an interest in influencing, recording, or studying dreams
                                    through innovative technological
                                    developments. Topics explored at the workshop included the science of lucid
                                    dreaming, physiological/sensory influences
                                    on dreaming, and memory replay and directed reactivation in sleep and dreams.
                                    Technologies explored included flexible
                                    circuit boards, optogenetics, portable olfactometers, and wearable cortisol
                                    sensors, each an opportunity for translating
