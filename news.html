                                <p>The Special Issue brings together a collection of papers on the theme of Dream
                                    Engineering – applying techniques and
                                    technologies for influencing, recording, and manipulating dreams to benefit
                                    memory, creativity or wellbeing. Invited
                                    contributors include those who attended the first international workshop on
                                    Dream Engineering hosted at the MIT Media
                                    Laboratory in January 2019, which was very successful in bringing together over
                                    50 leading scientists, dream researchers
                                    and engineers who have an interest in influencing, recording, or studying dreams
                                    through innovative technological
                                    developments. Topics explored at the workshop included the science of lucid
                                    dreaming, physiological/sensory influences
                                    on dreaming, and memory replay and directed reactivation in sleep and dreams.
                                    Technologies explored included flexible
                                    circuit boards, optogenetics, portable olfactometers, and wearable cortisol
                                    sensors, each an opportunity for translating
                                    sleep laboratory dream influencing techniques into real-world settings.

                                <p>Previous experiments combining cognitive techniques and sleep disruption have
                                    been
                                    relatively successful in inducing
                                    at-home lucid dreams (LD) over training periods of 1 week or more. Here, we
                                    induce
                                    LD in
                                    a single laboratory nap session
                                    by pairing cognitive training with external stimulation. Participants came to
                                    the
                                    laboratory at 7:30 a.m. or 11:00 a.m.
                                    and during polysomnography setup were provided with information about lucid
                                    dreaming.
                                    For 20 min prior to sleep the
                                    experimenter played alternating audio and visual cues at 1-min intervals.
                                    Participants
                                    were instructed to practice a
                                    mental state of critical self-awareness, observing their thoughts and
                                    experiences
                                    each
                                    time they noticed a cue. This
                                    procedure associated the cues with the trained mental state. Subsequently,
                                    participants
                                    were allowed 90 min to nap, and
                                    the audio and visual cues were presented during REM sleep to activate
                                    self-awareness
                                    in
                                    dreams and elicit lucidity. A
                                    control group followed the same procedure but was not cued during sleep. All
                                    participants were instructed to signal
                                    their lucidity by looking left and right 4 times (LR signal). Signal-verified
                                    lucid
                                    dreams (SVLDs) qualified as dreams
                                    in which the LR signal was observed and the participant reported becoming lucid.
                                    Across
                                    the 2 nap times, this protocol
                                    induced SVLDs in 50% of cued participants. In the absence of cueing during
                                    sleep,
                                    participant SVLD rate was 17%. Of
                                    note, 3 successful participants had never before experienced a LD, suggesting
                                    this
                                    protocol may be effective across the
                                    general population. Implications of this Targeted Lucidity Reactivation protocol
                                    for
                                    nightmare treatment are discussed.
