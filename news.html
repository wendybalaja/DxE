                                <p>Recent paper published in Current Biology features interactive dreaming.
                                  From the abstract: "Here we show that individuals who are asleep and in the midst of a lucid dream (aware of the fact that they are currently dreaming) can perceive questions from an experimenter and provide answers using electrophysiological signals. We implemented our procedures for two-way communication during polysomnographically verified rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in 36 individuals. Some had minimal prior experience with lucid dreaming, others were frequent lucid dreamers, and one was a patient with narcolepsy who had frequent lucid dreams. During REM sleep, these individuals exhibited various capabilities, including performing veridical perceptual analysis of novel information, maintaining information in working memory, computing simple answers, and expressing volitional replies. Their responses included distinctive eye movements and selective facial muscle contractions, constituting correctly answered questions on 29 occasions across 6 of the individuals tested. These repeated observations of interactive dreaming, documented by four independent laboratory groups, demonstrate that phenomenological and cognitive characteristics of dreaming can be interrogated in real time. This relatively unexplored communication channel can enable a variety of practical applications and a new strategy for the empirical exploration of dreams."

                                    Engineering – applying techniques and
                                    technologies for influencing, recording, and manipulating dreams to benefit
                                    memory, creativity or wellbeing. Invited
                                    contributors include those who attended the first international workshop on
                                    Dream Engineering hosted at the MIT Media
                                    Laboratory in January 2019, which was very successful in bringing together over
                                    50 leading scientists, dream researchers
                                    and engineers who have an interest in influencing, recording, or studying dreams
                                    through innovative technological
                                    developments. Topics explored at the workshop included the science of lucid
                                    dreaming, physiological/sensory influences
                                    on dreaming, and memory replay and directed reactivation in sleep and dreams.
                                    Technologies explored included flexible
                                    circuit boards, optogenetics, portable olfactometers, and wearable cortisol
                                    sensors, each an opportunity for translating
