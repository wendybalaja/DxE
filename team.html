                                    and quantitative analysis of EEG, including extraction of sleep features such as

                                    <strong>Dream Engineering.</strong>
                                    With colleagues at MIT, we are developing a network of researchers who work on the
                                    <a href="">theme of dream engineering</a>—applying
                                    technology and manipulating sleep and dreams to benefit memory, creativity,
                                    wellbeing, or even physical health and
                                    rehabilitation. We recently published a <a
                                        href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810020300325">
                                        theoretical review</a> on the topic and

                                    hosted at MIT Media Laboratory in January 2019, and guest edited a <a

                                    via sensory stimulation; Lucid dreams – where one is aware and in control of their
                                    dream while asleep – are an important
                                    and novel avenue of study for sleep medicine and nightmare treatment. Our <a

                                        findings</a> show we effectively induced
                                    lucid dreams in 50% of participants within one 3-hour session.

                                <p><strong>Bio: </strong>Pattie Maes is a professor in MIT's Program in Media Arts and
                                    Sciences. She runs the Media Lab's Fluid Interfaces
                                    research group, which investigates how devices can play a more positive and
                                    supportive
                                    role in people's lives. Coming
                                    from a background in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction, she is
                                    particularly interested in the topic
                                    of cognitive enhancement, or how immersive and wearable systems can actively assist
                                    people with memory, attention,
                                    learning, decision making, and wellbeing. Maes is the editor of three books, and is
                                    an

                                    reviewer for numerous professional journals and conferences. She has received
                                    several
                                    awards: Fast Company named her one
                                    of 50 most influential designers (2011); Newsweek picked her as one of the "100
                                    Americans to watch for" in the year
                                    2000; TIME Digital selected her as a member of the “Cyber Elite,” the top 50
                                    technological pioneers of the high-tech
                                    world; the World Economic Forum honored her with the title "Global Leader for
                                    Tomorrow";
                                    Ars Electronica awarded her the
                                    1995 World Wide Web category prize; and in 2000 she was recognized with the
                                    "Lifetime

                                    Massachusetts Interactive Media Council. She has also received an honorary doctorate
                                    from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel
                                    in Belgium, and her 2009 TED talk on "the 6th sense device" is among the
                                    most-watched
                                    TED talks ever.In addition to her
                                    academic endeavors, Maes has been an active entrepreneur as co-founder of several
                                    venture-backed companies, including
                                    Firefly Networks (sold to Microsoft), Open Ratings (sold to Dun & Bradstreet) and
                                    Tulip
                                    Co (privately held). Prior to
                                    joining the Media Lab, Maes was a visiting professor and a research scientist at the
                                    MIT
                                    Artificial Intelligence Lab.
                                    She holds a bachelor's degree in computer science and a PhD in artificial

                                <p><strong>Research Interest: </strong>My inter-disciplinary research group takes
                                    inspiration from the literature in Psychology and Neuroscience to design and
                                    invent new systems that assist people with issues such as memory, learning, and
                                    well-being. I am especially interested
                                    in the role that sleep and dreaming plays in these cognitive processes and hope to
                                    develop technology to influence
                                    dreams so as to strengthen learning, influence memory, and stimulate creative
                                    thinking.

                                    My work has been presented in a
                                    range of artistic and scientific
                                    spaces, Cannes Film Festival, GoogleX, SXSW, National Academy of Sciences, Red Bull

                                <p><strong>Research Interest: </strong>I’m very interested in how brain science can
                                    expand to interact with art, technology and policy. The organized
                                    understanding of the self is fertile territory for those guiding experience (i.e.
                                    artists), those guiding behavior (i.e.
                                    policymakers, technologists), and those guiding introspection (i.e. therapists,
                                    citizen scientists, and you). Until last
                                    year I helped lead two communities in Boston which aimed to expand the acceptable
                                    territory of inquiry for science and
                                    tech: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/510128/mit-hackathon/">MIT

                                    spending time bringing my tools to other
                                    labs for guiding dreams and nightmare treatment, working on neuroscience based
                                    prison policy change, and bridging art
                                    and neuroscience in a form that goes beyond ornamental.

                                <p><strong>Research Interest: </strong>Her research is in the field of human-computer
                                    interaction (HCI), she is interested in consciousness and the
                                    intersection between Engineering, Design and Behavioral and Physiological
                                    Psychology. Her research vision is to create
                                    technology that can interface with our unconscious mind for psychological well-being
                                    instead of for marketing purposes.
                                    Adopting insights from multidisciplinary fields, she aims to create subtle,
                                    sometimes unnoticeable technology that
                                    improves our well-being and augments our memory through nontraditional interfaces
                                    (such as smell) and that can be used
                                    during the day and while sleeping. She developed olfactory wearables, Virtual and
                                    Augmented Reality experiences that
                                    monitor physiological information of the user and that dynamically release scent or
                                    change their audio-visuals to reduce
                                    anxiety, enhance sleep quality and learning, with the ultimate goal of helping us be
                                    more mindful of our mental state,
                                    emotions, biases, and behavior.
