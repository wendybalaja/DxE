                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Bio: </strong> Carr is a researcher at the University of Rochester Sleep and
                                    Neurophysiology
                                    Laboratory. She previously worked
                                    at the Swansea University Sleep Laboratory in Wales, and prior to that received her
                                    PhD
                                    in Biomedical Science from the
                                    University of Montreal, where she conducted research at the Dream and Nightmare
                                    Laboratory. Her work explores techniques
                                    of inducing lucid dreams, prevalence and profiles of nightmare disorder, and the use
                                    of
                                    dreamwork and dream engineering
                                    for insight, well-being, and creativity.</p>
                                <p><strong>Research Interest: </strong>I have interests in modifying dreams through
                                    sensory
                                    stimulation, and inducing lucid dreams to enable two-way
                                    communication between dreamers and the waking world. I'm curious about how modifying
                                    dream content, either through
                                    waking practices, sensory stimulation or lucidity, may then impact on
                                    psychophysiology,
                                    memory, and other cognitive
                                    processes. </p>

                                <p><strong>Pattie Maes <br> Professor <br>MIT Media Lab </strong></p>
                                <p><strong>Bio: </strong>Pattie Maes is a professor in MIT's Program in Media Arts and
                                    Sciences. She runs the Media Lab's Fluid Interfaces
                                    research group, which investigates how devices can play a more positive and
                                    supportive
                                    role in people's lives. Coming
                                    from a background in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction, she is
                                    particularly interested in the topic
                                    of cognitive enhancement, or how immersive and wearable systems can actively assist
                                    people with memory, attention,
                                    learning, decision making, and wellbeing. Maes is the editor of three books, and is
                                    an
                                    editorial board member and
                                    reviewer for numerous professional journals and conferences. She has received
                                    several
                                    awards: Fast Company named her one
                                    of 50 most influential designers (2011); Newsweek picked her as one of the "100
                                    Americans to watch for" in the year
                                    2000; TIME Digital selected her as a member of the “Cyber Elite,” the top 50
                                    technological pioneers of the high-tech
                                    world; the World Economic Forum honored her with the title "Global Leader for
                                    Tomorrow";
                                    Ars Electronica awarded her the
                                    1995 World Wide Web category prize; and in 2000 she was recognized with the
                                    "Lifetime
                                    Achievement Award" by the
                                    Massachusetts Interactive Media Council. She has also received an honorary doctorate
                                    from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel
                                    in Belgium, and her 2009 TED talk on "the 6th sense device" is among the
                                    most-watched
                                    TED talks ever.In addition to her
                                    academic endeavors, Maes has been an active entrepreneur as co-founder of several
                                    venture-backed companies, including
                                    Firefly Networks (sold to Microsoft), Open Ratings (sold to Dun & Bradstreet) and
                                    Tulip
                                    Co (privately held). Prior to
                                    joining the Media Lab, Maes was a visiting professor and a research scientist at the
                                    MIT
                                    Artificial Intelligence Lab.
                                    She holds a bachelor's degree in computer science and a PhD in artificial
                                    intelligence
                                    from the Vrije Universiteit
                                    Brussel in Belgium.</p>
                                <p><strong>Research Interest: </strong>My inter-disciplinary research group takes
                                    inspiration from the literature in Psychology and Neuroscience to design and
                                    invent new systems that assist people with issues such as memory, learning, and
                                    well-being. I am especially interested
                                    in the role that sleep and dreaming plays in these cognitive processes and hope to
                                    develop technology to influence
                                    dreams so as to strengthen learning, influence memory, and stimulate creative
                                    thinking.
