                                        <p>The reliable induction of lucid dreams is a challenge in lucid dream
                                            research. In a previous study by our research group
                                            we were able to induce in about 50% of the participants a lucid dream in
                                            a single sleep laboratory night by combining a
                                            wake-up-back-to-bed sleep protocol and a mnemonic technique. In the
                                            present study, we extended our previous procedure by
                                            additional presentation of an odor during sleep to reactivate memory
                                            traces about reality testing. In total 16 male
                                            participants spent a single night in the sleep lab whereas the procedure
                                            induced in two participants a lucid dream
                                            (12.5%). The induction rate stays below the success rate of our previous
                                            study and therefore odor-cueing seems not a
                                            promising technique for inducing lucid dreams. Beside the odor
                                            presentation, several other methodological changes have
                                            been made, which will be discussed and hopefully help further dream
                                            engineering to improve induction techniques.

                                        <p>Lucid dreaming is a unique phenomenon with potential applications for
                                            therapeutic interventions. Few studies have
                                            investigated the effects of lucidity on an individual’s waking mood,
                                            which could have valuable implications for
                                            improving psychological wellbeing. The current experiment aims to
                                            investigate whether the experience of lucidity
                                            enhances positive waking mood, and whether lucidity is associated with
                                            dream emotional content and subjective sleep
                                            quality. 20 participants were asked to complete lucid dream induction
                                            techniques along with an online dream diary for
                                            one week, which featured a 19-item lucidity questionnaire, and
                                            subjective ratings of sleep quality, dream emotional
                                            content, and waking mood. Results indicated that higher lucidity was
                                            associated with more positive dream content and
                                            elevated positive waking mood the next day, although there was no
                                            relationship with sleep quality. The results of the
                                            research and suggestions for future investigations, such as the need for
                                            longitudinal studies of lucidity and mood, are
                                            discussed.

                                        <p>Information processing during sleep is active, ongoing and accessible to
                                            engineering. Protocols such as targeted memory
                                            reactivation use sensory stimuli during sleep to reactivate memories and
                                            demonstrate subsequent, specific enhancement of
                                            their consolidation. These protocols rely on physiological, as opposed
                                            to phenomenological, evidence of their
                                            reactivation. While dream content can predict post-sleep memory
                                            enhancement, dreaming itself remains a black box. Here,
                                            we present a novel protocol using a new wearable electronic device,
                                            Dormio, to automatically generate serial auditory
                                            dream incubations at sleep onset, wherein targeted information is
                                            repeatedly presented during the hypnagogic period,
                                            enabling direct incorporation of this information into dream content, a
                                            process we call targeted dream incubation (TDI).
                                            Along with validation data, we discuss how Dormio and TDI protocols can
                                            serve as tools for controlled experimentation on
                                            dream content, shedding light on the role of dreams in the overnight
                                            transformation of experiences into memories.
